# Figure Captions for Poster

## Figure 1: System Schematic
**Caption**: Hard-sphere particles (N=40) confined to an ellipse with eccentricity e=0.9. Color indicates local curvature κ(φ): yellow regions (poles, φ≈0,π) have maximum curvature where clusters form. Red circles show particle positions in a typical two-cluster configuration.

## Figure 2: Main Result - Density vs Curvature
**Caption**: Steady-state angular density ρ(φ) (bars) compared with local curvature κ(φ) (black line) for three eccentricities. Strong positive correlation (r = +0.50 to +0.89) demonstrates that particles accumulate at high-curvature regions. Data averaged over second half of 500s simulations.

## Figure 3: Two-Cluster Dynamics
**Caption**: (Left) Time evolution of order parameters: polar ψ = |⟨e^{iφ}⟩| and nematic S = |⟨e^{2iφ}⟩|. Shaded regions indicate S > ψ, signaling two-cluster dominance. (Right) Schematic of two-cluster state at ellipse poles.

## Figure 4: Parameter Dependence
**Caption**: (Left) Clustering probability increases with effective temperature E/N—counter to equilibrium expectations. (Right) Cluster formation time τ decreases with eccentricity: higher curvature contrast leads to faster aggregation.

## Figure 5: Velocity Profile and Density
**Caption**: Comparison of angular density ρ(φ) (blue bars), angular velocity φ̇ ∝ 1/√g_φφ (orange dashed), and curvature κ(φ) (green) for e=0.9. At the poles (φ = 0, π), curvature is maximum while angular velocity is minimum. Particles accumulate where they move slowest: the measured density correlates with curvature (r = +0.89), not with the equilibrium prediction. Vertical dotted lines mark the pole positions.

# Suggested Text to REMOVE from Figures

## Figure 1
- Remove: Parameter box (N=40, e=0.9, etc.) → put in caption
- Keep: "HIGH κ" labels at poles (useful visual reference)

## Figure 2
- Remove: "MAIN DISCOVERY" header → use as section title in poster
- Keep: Correlation values (r = +0.XX) inside panels

## Figure 3
- Remove: Equations in right panel → put in caption
- Keep: "Cluster" labels

## Figure 4
- Remove: "3× faster" annotation → put in caption
- Remove: "Higher E/N → MORE clustering" → put in caption

## Figure 5
- Remove: "SLOW"/"FAST" labels (optional, could keep)
- Remove: Numbered mechanism steps → put in caption or poster text

## Figure 6
- This is a summary figure, text is appropriate here
- Could simplify if used as poster header graphic
