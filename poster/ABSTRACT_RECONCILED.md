**Title**: Geometry-driven non-equilibrium phase transition in hard-sphere gas on 1-D elliptic curves

**Authors**: Jesús Isaí García Hernández, Hector Medel Cobaxin

**Abstract**: In this work we present a qualitative analysis of a non-equilibrium phase transition in hard-sphere gases confined on elliptic curves, where intrinsic geometry curvature drives spontaneous clustering. Using an exact symplectic integration we could reach a good relative energy conservation that allowed us to study the dynamics of clustering. We found a ranges of parameters where cluster follows deterministic and stochastic nucleation without the indication of thermodynamic criticality. Despite of energy conservation the system follows a not thermalized behavior in the domain of time we studied. The phenomenon resembles motility-induced phase separation in active matter but clearly arises from purely geometric conditions.

## Key Findings to Incorporate

From today's analysis (January 2026):

1. **Two-cluster states**: Particles form TWO clusters at ellipse poles (φ ≈ 0, π)
2. **Density-curvature relationship**: ρ(φ) ∝ κ(φ) with correlation r = +0.89 at e=0.9
3. **Anti-equilibrium behavior**: The steady-state does NOT follow the equilibrium measure √g
4. **Temperature dependence**: Higher E/N → MORE clustering (counter-intuitive)
5. **Order parameters**: Nematic S > polar ψ indicates two-cluster dominance

## Proposed Reconciled Abstract

**Title**: Curvature-Induced Clustering in Hard-Sphere Gases on Elliptic Manifolds: A Non-Equilibrium Steady State

**Authors**: Jesús Isaí García Hernández, Hector Medel Cobaxin

**Abstract** (Option 1 - Technical):

We report the discovery of curvature-induced clustering in hard-sphere gases confined to one-dimensional elliptic curves. Using symplectic integration with energy conservation ΔE/E₀ ~ 10⁻⁹, we observe spontaneous two-cluster formation at the ellipse poles—the regions of maximum curvature. Remarkably, the steady-state density profile ρ(φ) correlates positively with local curvature (r = +0.89), contrary to the equilibrium prediction ρ ∝ √g. We find that higher effective temperature promotes clustering, indicating a non-equilibrium steady state driven by collision dynamics rather than thermodynamic criticality. The phenomenon shares mechanistic similarities with motility-induced phase separation in active matter but arises purely from geometric constraints. Our results establish a direct link between manifold curvature and collective behavior in conservative systems.

**Abstract** (Option 2 - Closer to original):

We present a study of geometry-driven clustering in hard-sphere gases confined on elliptic curves, where intrinsic curvature induces spontaneous aggregation at high-curvature regions. Using exact symplectic integration with excellent energy conservation (ΔE/E₀ ~ 10⁻⁹), we characterize the clustering dynamics across a range of eccentricities and energies. The system exhibits two-cluster states localized at the ellipse poles, with density profiles proportional to local curvature rather than the equilibrium measure. We observe deterministic and stochastic nucleation without thermodynamic criticality, and counter-intuitively, higher temperature promotes clustering. Despite energy conservation, the system reaches a non-equilibrium steady state distinct from thermal equilibrium. The phenomenon resembles motility-induced phase separation in active matter but arises purely from geometric conditions.

## Key Differences from Original

1. **"Phase transition" → "Clustering" or "Steady State"**: Our data shows metastable dynamics (6-14% time clustered), not a sharp transition

2. **Added**: Two-cluster nature (emphasized nematic order S)

3. **Added**: Quantitative result ρ ∝ κ with correlation coefficient

4. **Added**: Anti-equilibrium finding (ρ ∝ 1/√g, not √g)

5. **Preserved**: Analogy to motility-induced phase separation

6. **Preserved**: Purely geometric origin

## Talking Points for Presentation

1. **The system**: 40 hard-sphere particles on ellipse, elastic collisions, symplectic integration

2. **The observation**: Particles spontaneously cluster at the ellipse poles (high-κ regions)

3. **The surprise**: This is OPPOSITE to what equilibrium statistical mechanics predicts

4. **The key result**: ρ(φ) ∝ κ(φ), with correlation r = +0.89

5. **The mechanism**: Collision-mediated trapping at slow-velocity (high-κ) regions

6. **The analogy**: Like traffic jams at sharp curves, or active matter at boundaries

7. **The implication**: Geometry alone can drive collective behavior in conservative systems
