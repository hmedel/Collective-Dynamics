We report spontaneous clustering in hard-sphere gases confined to elliptic manifolds driven by intrinsic geometric curvature. Using energy-conserving symplectic integration (ΔE/E₀ ~ 10⁻⁹) across 240 simulations, we show particles undergo 98% spatial compactification by accumulating at high-curvature regions through a first-order-like transition.

At optimal eccentricity (e=0.5, N=40), clustering follows deterministic nucleation (Gamma-distributed, k=3.37) with a single avalanche event. Away from optimum, nucleation becomes stochastic (k≈1.2) and fragmented. We extract non-universal critical exponents β=-0.73 and ν=1.28 near e_c=0.5; the negative β indicates a "Goldilocks point" rather than thermodynamic criticality.

The system never thermalizes despite energy conservation—velocity distributions remain non-Maxwellian and ergodicity is broken. The phenomenon resembles Motility-Induced Phase Separation in active matter but arises purely from manifold geometry without dissipation.

Our results establish curved manifolds as platforms for engineering non-equilibrium collective behavior with applications to membrane biophysics and topological materials.
