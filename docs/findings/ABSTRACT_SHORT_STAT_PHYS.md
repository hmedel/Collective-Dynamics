We report a novel non-equilibrium phase transition in hard-sphere gases confined to elliptic manifolds, where intrinsic geometric curvature drives spontaneous clustering absent in flat-space systems. Using exact symplectic integration with energy conservation to ΔE/E₀ ~ 10⁻⁹, we demonstrate that particles initially distributed uniformly undergo extreme spatial compactification (98% reduction in angular spread) by accumulating at high-curvature regions through a first-order-like transition.

**System**: N hard spheres (N=20-80) on ellipse with eccentricity e ∈ [0.5, 0.9], governed by Hamiltonian dynamics in curved coordinates. The position-dependent Riemannian metric g_φφ(φ) and curvature κ(φ) create geometric forces encoded in Christoffel symbols, causing particles to decelerate at high-curvature endpoints (major axis) analogous to cars braking in tight turns. This produces longer residence times, enhanced collision rates, and momentum exchange that traps low-energy particles.

**Key findings** from 240 independent simulations across parameter space:

1. **Nucleation mechanism**: At optimal eccentricity (e=0.5, N=40), clustering follows deterministic nucleation (Gamma-distributed times, shape k=3.37) with a single dominant avalanche. Away from optimum (e=0.9), nucleation becomes stochastic (k≈1.2) with fragmented dynamics.

2. **Non-universal critical exponents**: Near e_c=0.5, we extract β=-0.73 and ν=1.28. The negative β indicates e_c is a "Goldilocks point" (optimal geometric balance) rather than thermodynamic criticality, fundamentally distinct from standard universality classes (Ising: β=0.125, ν=1).

3. **Broken ergodicity**: Velocity distributions remain non-Maxwellian post-clustering despite energy conservation, confirming the system never thermalizes. Spatial correlations develop sharp peaks (ξ~0.5 rad) inconsistent with equilibrium.

4. **Geometric phase separation**: Clustering exhibits features analogous to Motility-Induced Phase Separation (MIPS) in active matter, but driven purely by manifold geometry without intrinsic activity or dissipation.

**Significance**: Establishes curved manifolds as platforms for engineering non-equilibrium collective behavior, with applications to membrane biophysics, colloidal systems on droplets, and topological materials. The work bridges geometric mechanics, active matter, and critical phenomena, demonstrating that curvature alone can fundamentally alter phase behavior.
